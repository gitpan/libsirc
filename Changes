Revision history for the libsirc distribution.

0.12

    - Sirc::URL is a new module which provides an easy way to view URLs
      which appear on the screen.

    - Sirc::Util:

    	- addcmd() is an enhanced version of sirc's.  It lets you define
    	  commands whose names contain non-alphanumeric characters.

    	- addhelp() is an enhanced version of sirc's.  It both adds the
    	  new command to the main help topic (or "set" topic), and
    	  provides a way to add help without hardcoding the format that
    	  help entries use.

	- arg_count_error() supplies the subroutine name if it's undef.

	- settable_boolean() allows you to supply a validator function.

	- settable_str() is a new function, similar to settable_int().

0.11  Fri Jun 02 15:38:29 EDT 2000

    - Tweak /limitman algorithm to try to keep the slaves a constant
      distance in time from the master.

    - Cut default /limitman timings in half.

0.10  Fri Jun 02 18:56:59 EDT 2000

    - Add Sirc::LimitMan.

    - Add %Chan_limit and limit hook to Sirc::Chantrack.

    - Add by_server() and newtimer() to Sirc::Util.

0.09

    - Add missing '1' to the end of Autoop.pm.  It was working by
      happenstance in real life but not when run from 'make test' (due
      to the dummy addhook()).

0.08  Tue May 18 22:39:27 EDT 1999

    - Allow ops to control your autovoice_delay by sending you specially
      formatted /msgs.

0.07  Mon May 03 23:28:27 EDT 1999

    - Fix Sirc::Autoop's %Autovoice not to +v people who didn't have it
      before you arrived.  Instead, they're noted as being -v.

    - Have Sirc::Util::settable_int set the variable to 0 if it's undef,
      else /set won't work on it.

0.06  Fri Jan 08 18:06:52 EST 1999

    - Move the version from Makefile.PL to Sirc::Util.  Use it to put
      the library name and version in $::add_ons.

    - Move ban_pattern() from Sirc::Kick to Sirc::Util.

    - Add Sirc::Util::mask_to_re().

    - Have Sirc::Autoop's %Autovoice work based on ban_pattern rather
      than nick.

0.05  Wed Dec 23 00:41:50 EST 1998

    - Oops, Sirc::LckHash wasn't in the MANIFEST.  One should always run
      a disttest or at least a distcheck!

0.04  Wed Dec 23 00:01:35 EST 1998

    - Add Sirc::LckHash, a class tied hash class which downcases the
      keys.  This used to be in Sirc::Util as Tie::LckHash.

    - Add %Autovoice to Sirc::Autoop.

    - Don't allow importation Sirc::Autoop's variables which are also
      /settable, as setting them directly (rather than via doset) causes
      the /set output to be wrong.

0.03  Fri Nov 27 11:48:45 EST 1998

    - Add voice capabilities to Sirc::Chantrack and Sirc::Autoop.

    - Allow $Autoop_delay to be a code ref which calculates the delay.
      Default to having the delay be 3, 5, 7 or 9 seconds.

    - Add autoop_verbose setting, default off.  Right now this controls
      the "Queueing +o" message.

0.02  Thu Oct 22 23:13:22 EDT 1998

    - Add Sirc::Autoop and Sirc::Kick modules.

    - Add timer() to Sirc::Utils.  This is like main::timer except the
      code arg can be a code reference.

    - Still no documentation, sorry.  UTS, L.

0.01  Tue Dec 16 19:00:00 EST 1997

    - Initial version.
