This is the libsirc distribution.  It contains modules which are useful
for programming sirc, a Perl-based IRC client.  To build it run

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

The documentation is embeded in the modules themselves,

    perldoc Sirc/<module>.pm

to read it before installation.

The latest version of the distribution can be found on CPAN, or at
http://www.argon.org/~roderick/.
