This is the libsirc distribution, code which works with sirc, a Perl-based
IRC client.  Included are both modules which have user-level functionality,
and modules which are useful for programming.

To build it, run:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

For more detailed instructions see "man perlmodinstall", "perldoc
perlmodinstall", or http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html.

The documentation is embeded in the modules themselves,

    perldoc Sirc/<module>.pm

to read it before installation.

The latest version of the distribution can be found on CPAN, or at
http://www.argon.org/~roderick/.
